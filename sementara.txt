As a NOC Engineer, I have an idea of making my colleague those linux engineer has easy to use VPN. Thats why now I'm doing my research to have a centralized VPN that can be manageable and has simple GUI like softether VPN. They offer many things like below:
- https://www.softether.org/4-docs/2-howto/1.VPN_for_On-premise/3.LAN_to_LAN_Bridge_VPN
- https://www.softether.org/4-docs/2-howto/6.VPN_Server_Behind_NAT_or_Firewall/1.Dynamic_DNS_and_NAT_Traversal
- https://www.softether.org/1-features/1._Ultimate_Powerful_VPN_Connectivity
But most important, thing because we have a lot of customers and using so many VPN providers and having difficulties while connecting and managing the user and password this feature are interesting enough.
- https://www.softether.org/4-docs/2-howto/4.VPN_for_IT_Professionals/1.Remote_Management

Here's what I done so far:
- Installed softether VPN server inside rental vps who have public ipv4 and no nat, so all ports are open
- access the server via softether VPN server manager in my own computer and able to setup regular softether protocol using Office virtual hub and OpenVPN. Both of them share the same IP with secure-nat enabled. All of them tested successfully using different internet ways, one is fixed broadband and also mobile network.

Here's what I never yer successful:
- Since L2TP/IPSec and PPTP were no longer supported in android 12 and later. I can't connect to android devices using IKEv2 to connect. The solution right now is using autogenerated OpenVPN from softether only for remote_access_l3, and the site_to_site bridge no longer supported
- I set up my own PC who has so many layers behind nat can't even ping my own public IP. I thought softether offers so many ways to break and puch a hole in firewall and able to make tunnel. If you see from the documentation link I've provided so far it can and easy but my approach seems fail to make a tunnel.
- I even try to connect my own vps as a cascade server inside my own PC and still yet not able to ping that domain of my host. if it works it should ping host  vpn157662167.opengw.net and should reply 27.124.95.28 but the responses were "request time out".
