# Step by step Java Procedure for Web App Deployment and Development
## [**back to Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice**](../README.md)

### [**0. (**Mandatory!)** Read ```"Overview of How the Server Runs"``` first.** ](./0/Overview-HTTP.md)
Once you read that, you are now knowing that in order to run a website indeed needed a running http service inside the linux server. After that, let's jump in into installation process.

### [**1. Installing Apache Tomcat Server and Apache HTTP Server on Master Server âœ…** ](./1/Installing-ApacheTomcat_and_ApacheHTTP.md)

- You might ask something like this, "I think using **Apache HTTP** server is enough to host my web page, why do I need **Apache Tomcat**?" [**This video will help you out.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XABDkzxA6hM)

### **2. (Optional!) Preparing the Environment to Start Coding on your Desktop Workspace**

**There are several things that you need to understand and prepare before you want to set-up your coding environment which are listed as follows:**

- Knowledge in **Java Programming** Language. [**Here are the basic structure of Java Program.**](/Additional-Notes/Basic-Structure_of_Java-Program.md)
- Interested in **Java Programming ?** I'm recommending you to [**watch the roadmaps here**](/Additional-Notes/Java&SpringBoot-roadmap.md). So, you can effectively improve your skills in which direction.
- Installing **Java SDK** or **OpenJDK** and **Apache Maven** on Windows. [**Here's the steps**](/Java-Webapps-Simulation/2/java-jdk-maven_installation.md)
- Start Code and choosing your skeleton project using **Spring Boot** or **Maven Archetype**. [**Here's the steps**](./2/Code-editor_setup.md)

### [**3. Here are the package files in ```".jar" & ".war"``` for Simulation if you wanted to skip coding progress.**](/installer/)

### [**4. Deploy webapps in Apache Tomcat and Reverse the Requests to Apache HTTP using ```mod_proxy.```**](/TBD)

### [**5. Deploy webapps in Apache Tomcat and Broadcast It on Apache HTTP using ```mod_jk.```**]()


### [**6. Perform webapps Integration with existing MySQL Database**](./TBD)
