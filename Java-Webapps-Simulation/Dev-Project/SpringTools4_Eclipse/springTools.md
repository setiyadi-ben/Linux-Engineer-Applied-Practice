## Quick Note
Using Eclipse IDE with Spring Tools built-in has an **advantages compared to the other such as this app has pre-installed java and maven also working fine on windows 10 or later**.

## Installation, Setup and Exercising the Demo Project
  
For the installation steps, I'm referring to Mr. [**McKenzie's video on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-6_gJoWYwM). As a beginner of "Educationist Documenter", I'm only change my directory installation file into .gitginore-files in this repository. The intention is to bypass the file being tracked by git and make the repository lighter on storage usage.
