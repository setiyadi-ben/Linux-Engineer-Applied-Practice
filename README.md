# Linux Engineering Journey
### Remember, my journey and your journey most likely will be different. So, make this repository as a reference and keep an eye to fresh job ads in order to stay relevant.
There are several fields that are included in [**Linux Engineering Roles**](/Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice/Additional-Notes/Multiple-Linux_Roles_Expertise.md) if you want to master it. I have a dream to **build my own dream SaaS (Software as a Service).** So, while doing a lot of practices and simulations, I'm also taking a bit more time documenting the work that I have done, aiming to make the environment itself more convenient whenever I wanted to re-learn on specific topics.

My goal is to learn from industry practices, the good thing is I'm guided by mentorship from senior engineers with a bunch of discussions about his past experiences. He also sometimes mention his jargon to me says, **"If you are javanese, then you should learn java it's a must"**. So, this the main reason I wanted to know more about Linux Engineering especially when coming into developing an enterprise application using Java ecosystems.

I’ve observed at my current company as an employee here and not affiliated with ownership, I’m careful to avoid any use of confidential data, adhering strictly to company policies that protect trade secrets.

## What is SaaS?
Software as a Service (SaaS) is traditionally considered a cloud-based software model that delivers applications to end-users through an internet browser. SaaS vendors host services and applications for customers to access on-demand. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/saas/">read more (AWS).</a>

# The Architectures

## 1. Monolithic System, Linux Server

<p>The monolithic system means, 1 single linux vm reposible for running multiple services in the same host machine. Most of the time installation is done manually, easy for newcomers, simple and maintainable for small companies.</p>

<p>This below are the common jobs that has been done by system administrators and any other similar positions in this relevant fields.</p>

## 2. Containerization System Overview (Docker)

<p align="center"><img src="/image-files/prod/infra/l-e-a-p infra overview.png"></p>

<p>The priority itself is inside the purple circle, but I would like to explore more. The aim is being able to run all services from monolithic systems using docker-compose.yml</p>

## - Development using Java
- [On the go learning Java programming](/Java-Development/index.md)
<p>To be honest, it's been a while I have passsively not continuing to learn Java. The thing that I can give to you is this, "Java is great and understandable code, but then I realized that learning only doesn't solve my problem. So, with that, what I need was to redo learning mysql for the bottom of the concept.   "</p>
