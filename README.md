Here are my steps to becoming a Linux Engineer

If you are thinking about the ideas of **"What should I learn?"** You can watch this video to have more insight to decide whether this repository is still relevant to you or it wasn't.

[**What should you Learn?! | Gaining Experience for your Linux Career**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaFITB2wuUQ)

**Summary of the video above:** Watching job ads requirements frequently, because to be able to stay relevant you must know what are the industry needs.

### **Additional Notes** that you might be interesting in it.
While doing a lot of simulations, I'm encountering problem by problem because of my unexperienced knowledge in several things that happen each time learning something new and try to documentize it on github. So, each time you and myself missed about a thing, we can refer back here.

# Linux Engineering Journey
### Remember, my journey and your journey most likely will be different. So, make this repository as a reference and keep an eye to a fresh job ads in order to stay relevant.
There are several fields that are included in [**Linux Engineering Roles**](/Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice/Additional-Notes/Multiple-Linux_Roles_Expertise.md) to able to master it. While I have a dream to **build my dream SaaS (Software as a Service).** So, while doing a lot of simulations, I'm also taking a bit more time to documenting the work that have done to make it more convenient whenever I wanted to re-learn on that.

Currently, **my learning path are starting from Database Administration** to understand the concept of how data are flowing and stored. **Next, learning about Software Development and Scripting,** focusing in **Web Application Development using Java** as main programming language. In order to make the software is accessible by the customer with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) form. Why using Java? Because you are Javanese person, so it's a must.
