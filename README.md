# Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice (L-E-A-P)
Here are my steps to becoming a Linux Engineer

If you are thinking about the ideas of **"What should I learn?"** You can watch this video to have more insight to decide whether this repository is still relevant to you or it wasn't.

[**What should you Learn?! | Gaining Experience for your Linux Career**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaFITB2wuUQ)

**Summary of the video above:** Watching job ads requirements frequently, because to be able to stay relevant you must know what are the industry needs.

### **Additional Notes** that you might be interesting in it.
While doing a lot of simulations, I'm encountering problem by problem because of my unexperienced knowledge in several things that happen each time learning something new and try to documentize it on github. So, each time you and myself missed about a thing, we can refer back here.

# Linux Engineering Journey
### Remember, my journey and your journey most likely will be different. So, make this repository as a reference and keep an eye to a fresh job ads in order to stay relevant.
There are several fields that are included in [**Linux Engineering Roles**](/Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice/Additional-Notes/Multiple-Linux_Roles_Expertise.md) if you want to master it. I have a dream to **build my own dream SaaS (Software as a Service).** So, while doing a lot of practices and simulations, I'm also taking a bit more time documenting the work that I have done, aiming to make the environment itself more convenient whenever I wanted to re-learn on specific topics.

My goal is to learn from industry practices, the good thing is I'm guided by mentorship from senior engineers with a bunch of discussions about his past experiences. He also sometimes mention his jargon to me says, **"If you are javanese, then you should learn java it's a must"**. So, this the main reason I wanted to know more about Linux Engineering especially when coming into developing an enterprise application using Java ecosystems.

I’ve observed at my current company as an employee here and not affiliated with ownership, I’m careful to avoid any use of confidential data, adhering strictly to company policies that protect trade secrets.

## What is SaaS?
Software as a Service (SaaS) is traditionally considered a cloud-based software model that delivers applications to end-users through an internet browser. SaaS vendors host services and applications for customers to access on-demand. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/saas/">read more</a>
