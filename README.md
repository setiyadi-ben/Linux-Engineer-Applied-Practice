Here are my steps to becoming a Linux Engineer

If you are thinking about the ideas of **"What should I learn?"** You can watch this video to have more insight to decide whether this repository is still relevant to you or it wasn't.

**Summary of the video above:** Watching job ads requirements frequently, because to be able to stay relevant you must know what are the industry needs.

### **Additional Notes** that you might be interesting in it.
While doing a lot of simulations, I'm encountering problem by problem because of my unexperienced knowledge in several things that happen each time learning something new and try to documentize it on github. So, each time you and myself missed about a thing, we can refer back here.

# Linux Engineering Journey
### Remember, my journey and your journey most likely will be different. So, make this repository as a reference and keep an eye to a fresh job ads in order to stay relevant.
There are several fields that are included in [**Linux Engineering Roles**](/Linux-Engineer-Applied-Practice/Additional-Notes/Multiple-Linux_Roles_Expertise.md) to able to master it. While I have a dream to **build my dream SaaS (Software as a Service).** So, while doing a lot of simulations, I'm also taking a bit more time to documenting the work that I have done, to make it more convenient whenever I wanted to re-learn on specific topics.

I’m currently working on developing my own private SaaS platform as a personal project, inspired by the technical standards I’ve observed at my current company. While I’m an employee here and not affiliated with ownership, I’m careful to avoid any use of confidential data, adhering strictly to company policies that protect trade secrets. My goal is to learn from industry practices, such as Java programming and Apache tools, which my employer uses for its secure systems.

Guided by mentorship from senior engineers, I’ve prioritized mastering Java and the Spring framework to build reliable systems. To practice, I’ve set up a virtual lab environment (using VMware) to deploy services like databases and web servers independently. However, as my project grows, managing these manually has become challenging, prompting me to explore scalable solutions like microservices.

To adapt, I’m splitting my system into two approaches: a unified “monolithic” structure for simplicity and modular “container-based” components for flexibility. This ensures I can align with diverse company infrastructures, whether they use traditional setups or modern cloud tools. My focus remains on self-driven learning, problem-solving, and creating adaptable solutions—skills that translate well to any team or organizational need.

## The First Plan

<!-- I have the idea of building my own private owned SaaS coming from the first company who I currently working in. This company has a strong rules regarding the terms "confidential" this means that every information inside the company is strictly hidden because it contains trade secret inside, which most of the company are implementing the same rules.

Some of the information that I can get from a lot of discussion is the company using the top notch security standards that is powered by java programming language, apache products and new microservices infrastructure.

While surfing the internet, I'm seeing a potential in Java especially my senior engineer on the company highlighting that, if you are javanese then you should able to master that don't question why? It's a must, and after several week passes i found out that spring framework is reliable for development so I'm also after finishing the java training would likely to continue learn and researching the best practices that can be applied in my new systems.

I'm started to working on to this repository with virualized VM using VMWare and able to deploy several services like mysql, phpmyadmin, apache2 and tomcat and many more following my own path. But the problem occur when in the next couple years and the services getting bigger and bigger to maintaining them. So, with that I'm starting to learn microservices and started to parallely split into 2 main infrastructure that are monolitchic and container based.

With that, I can easily adapt in whatever company requirements they already have. -->


~~Currently, **my learning path are starting from Database Administration** to understand the concept of how data are flowing and stored. **Next, learning about Software Development and Scripting,** focusing in **Web Application Development using Java** as main programming language. In order to make the software is accessible by the customer with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) form. Why using Java? Because you are Javanese person, so it's a must.~~
