# The Development using Java
Before starting to develop apps or web apps, here is a step-by-step guide that I wanted to provide:
<p align="justify">
1. We have to first recognizing what is your main goals with a simple visualization in any form that anyone can understand the idea.
<br>
2. After we know about the idea, now we can have a multiple raw requirements that come into mind like: how many active users will be, how many data that will be handled soon, is it need to be stored lifetime? Or maybe periodically being removed? What are the main features that the app will be used by customers and etc.
<br>
3. After that, you can check the following theories about Java <a href="/Additional-Notes/Table-of-Contents.md">here</a>, it highlights about the roadmaps, ecosystems and multiple explanations along the way.
<br>
4. If all of the 3 steps above have been marked âœ…, all you have to do is keep continue untill you succedeed, there will be a lot of taking breaks in the process but, someone who never quits and continues after falling down they are the person who is able to catch their dreams in the future.
<br>
5. From the requirements that you have in mind, build your own path and draw it as your visual pipelines to finish each checkpoints that you decide yourself. Programming is huge, so my advice is while learning focus on the requirements first, if there's no other option you can leave you current requirement and find the best practices that is suitable. This is the way you avoid burnout while commiting to working as a developer.
